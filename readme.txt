Final Project: Character Creation

download all attached files. 
Once you get to the file path run in node js command line:
"npm install" 
then execute
"npm start"

server will now run on localhost/3000 (or a specified input)


Implementation Criteria:
The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
- I have created a well designed layout with HTML and CSS.
Pages link together through a Header. 404 Error pageis also prevent
for invalid location.


The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
-Interactions between pages and through the form are working through js


The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
-Website is working through node server.js with connection between the server and client.

The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store.
-Characters on the Explore Page are created dynamically through a character.json file.
Editing the contents and characters in the file will change what is being shown on the explore page
(after the server is restarted)

The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create,
read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.
-This was the one part of the Project that I was not able to impliment. I have all the 
pieces in place to, when a from is completed, load it into the character.json and dynamically
update the Explore page. I ran out of time during my implementation. 
If I had given myself more time I would have incorporated the CRUD schema.(create, Read, Update, and Delete)
